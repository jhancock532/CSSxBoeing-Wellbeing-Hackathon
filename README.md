# CSSxBoeing Wellbeing Hackathon

## Competition Results
Awarded the Best Individual Mental Health Project prize. The original awards the competition was based around were Best Mental Health Project, Best Safety Project, Best Fitness Project, however the judges made an exception in allocating prizes for my case. They recognised the work I'd completed as a solo team member, and so extended the Best Mental Health Project to two teams - A team of 6 final year students and me. 

## Motive
* Real stories are shared on this website to help visitors understand that they are not alone in facing their issues, with quotes used to capture key insights. 
* Through reading another person's story, identifying and empathising with the writer, some of our shame is lessened in turn.
* When we learn how they faced their difficulty, new possibilities for how we face our own difficulties open up to us. 

## Website Functionality
* A basic search function which lists stories and quotes.
* Login feature so only a registered user can add stories or quotes.
* Forms to add a story / quote (this worked fine until the presentation!).
* MySQL database for persistant story / quote storage.

## Event Details
The event lasted 24 hours, starting 8/3/19 at 3pm then finishing the following day.

I completed the project by myself, under the team name of Bootstrap 9000, reflecting how I used spring boot and bootstrap.css for developing the server and style.
