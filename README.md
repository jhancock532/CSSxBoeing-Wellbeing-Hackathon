# CSSxBoeing Wellbeing Hackathon

A website aggregating personal stories of how people overcame difficulties in their life.

* Real stories are shared on this website to help visitors understand that they are not alone in facing their issues, with quotes used to capture key insights. 
* Through reading another person's story, identifying and empathising with the writer, some of our shame is lessened in turn.
* When we learn how they faced their difficulty, new possibilities for how we face our own difficulties open up to us. 

The event lasted 24 hours, starting 8/3/19 at 3pm then finishing the following day.

I completed the project as a solo team, under the team name of Bootstrap 9000, reflecting how I used spring boot and bootstrap.css for developing the server and style.
