# CSSxBoeing Wellbeing Hackathon

## Motive
* Real stories are shared on this website to help visitors understand that they are not alone in facing their issues, with quotes used to capture key insights. 
* Through reading another person's story, identifying and empathising with the writer, some of our shame is lessened in turn.
* When we learn how they faced their difficulty, new possibilities for how we face our own difficulties open up to us. 

## Website Functionality
* A basic search function which lists stories and quotes.
* Login feature so only a registered user can add stories or quotes.
* Forms to add a story / quote (this worked fine until the presentation!).
* MySQL database for persistant story / quote storage.

## Event Details
The event lasted 24 hours, starting 8/3/19 at 3pm then finishing the following day.

I completed the project as a solo team, under the team name of Bootstrap 9000, reflecting how I used spring boot and bootstrap.css for developing the server and style.

## Competition Results
* Awarded Best Mental Health Project prize, a joint award with another team.
