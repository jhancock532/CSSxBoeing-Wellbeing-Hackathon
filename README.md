# CSSxBoeing Wellbeing Hackathon

A 24 hour hackathon event run by the University of Bristol's Computer Science Society in collaboration with Boeing. I completed the project solo, under the team name of *Bootstrap 9000* - I used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [bootstrap.css](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) for developing the server and styling the site.

## Competition Results
Awarded the [Best Individual Project Prize](https://twitter.com/CSSBristol/status/1106484984968302592). The original awards that the competition was based around were Best Mental Health Project, Best Safety Project, Best Fitness Project; however, the judges made an exception in allocating an extra prize for my project.

## The Pitch
* This is a website which aggregates personal stories from people who've overcome large difficulties in their lives.
* Real stories are shared to help visitors understand that they are not alone in facing their issues.
* When we learn how another person faced a difficulty similar to ours, new possibilities open up to us. We can identify and empathise with the writer.
* Reading more stories, we learn more about what it means to be human; that we are all facing difficulties, that no-one is perfect, and that this is ok. 
* Understanding this, we start to lessen our expectations for ourselves, lessen the guilt we have about our actions and lessen the shame we have built up inside us.
* You might read a story, try something new and it doesn't work. That's ok! We're all unique, different things work for different people. 
* There are **many ways** to overcome our difficulties - try different things, find what works for you.

## Website Functionality
* A basic search function which lists stories and quotes.
* Login feature so only a registered user can add stories or quotes.
* Forms to add a story / quote (this worked fine until the presentation!).
* MySQL database for persistant story / quote storage.
